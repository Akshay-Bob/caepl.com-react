                After realising the potential of photoengraving and
                block-making, Framroze Poonawala purchased a second-hand plant
                from England consisting of machines dating back to the early
                1900s and set up Commercial Art Engravers in Bombay, India in
                1934.{" "}

                Guided by a passion for and commitment to the preservation of
                India’s rich cultural heritage, CAE quickly established itself
                as being the best in the business and worked with museums from
                all over India. The Lalit Kala Akademi, the Prince of Wales
                Museum, Bharat Kala Bhavan in Bhopal, and the National Museum
                exclusively entrusted CAE with the reproduction of their
                miniatures.{" "}

                The first Indian pre-press house to install the Vario
                Klischograph scanner in 1969, "Dark Room" cameras from West
                Germany, powderless etching technology from Japan, proofing
                machines from Switzerland and film processors from the U.S.A.,
                CAE was at the forefront of modernization.

                On Framroze’s son, Burjor’s return from the London College of
                Printing and Graphic Arts in 1959, he brought with him the
                pioneering developments in the West back home to India. During
                the late 1970s, printing by blocks was replaced by offset
                lithography, and from CAE, Comart Lithographers was born. With
                state-of-the-art technology, and highly skilled creative
                craftsmen, CAE remained a leader in the field of graphic
                reproduction by photolithography.
